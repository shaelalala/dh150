## Shae Zhou's User Experience Design - A Learning Process

Embark on a journey with me to recollect my defining moments of learning to be a UX designer. 
From teaching programming courses to six-year-olds, to combining interests in Psychology and Design, to eventually putting skills into practice. 

### LeapLearner

In 2017, early education businesses were already thriving. Especially in China, where parents value their children's education as first priority, children are constantly being ushered to tutoring classes and extracurricular activities, even during their kindergarten years. A common saying in China is - "Winning at the starting line". 

When I started a summer internship at LeapLearner, a start-up focused on early programming education, I taught courses to kids in the age group of 6-8. However, my fellow teachers and I all found that for the same curriculum, there was a huge descrepency between children who had started elementary school and those who were a year younger.
