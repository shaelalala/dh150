### *Usability Test (Pilot)*


#### Introduction/Purpose of UT: 

  23andMe is a biotechnology company offering personalized scientific reports about users' ancestry and health based on their DNA. The 23andMe app is a tool providing easy access to the reports and offers a variety of information regarding the 
results of the DNA analysis. 
  
  The user experience designer conducted a usability test using a registered 23andMe account on the moderator's mobile phone.
  A laptop recorded the participant's facial reactions and comments, as well as the answers to the questionnaire. The moderator was present to ask questions, guide the participant to answer the questionnaire, and take notes. The participant's navigational choices, task completion, comments, and feedback to the questionnaire was recorded. 

  Based on the findings of the heuristic evaluation, the usability test was designed to find out whether the user 
would find the information presented on the 23andMe app too complicated to understand and navigate through. Three 
scenarios were designed around the main functions built into the app: accessing ancestry reports, accessing health 
reports, and answering research questions. 
  The tasks were designed in steps, from easier to harder. The test was structured such that each task in a certain 
scenario could be found under the same heading/menu page in the app. During the process of completing the steps, the
user could go at his or her own pace to explore the functions available in the app.

##### Pilot Test Reflection: 

Although after the heuristic evaluation I was concerned about whether the information was too complex for an average user
to read, the tasks I designed in the Usability Test perhaps did not offer a lot of time for the user to process the large
amount of information offered in the reports. Or perhaps I assumed users would want to read all of the information, but 
instead the participant was not that interested in the details of the information. In a focus group interview, I would try 
to find more participants that fit the target users of 23andMe, and ask them more specific questions such as what types 
of info in the reports they are most interested in, and what functions they use the most, etc.
