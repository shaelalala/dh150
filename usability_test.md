  Based on the findings of the heuristic evaluation, the usability test was designed to find out whether the user 
would find the information presented on the 23andMe app too complicated to understand and navigate through. Three 
scenarios were designed around the main functions built into the app: presenting ancestry reports, presenting health 
reports, and answering research questions. 
  The tasks were designed in steps, from easier to harder. The test was structured such that each task in a certain 
scenario could be found under the same heading/menu page in the app. During the process of completing the steps, the
user could go at his or her own pace to explore the functions available in the app.

Pilot Test Reflection: 

Although after the heuristic evaluation I was concerned about whether the information was too complex for an average user
to read, the tasks I designed in the Usability Test perhaps did not offer a lot of time for the user to process the large
amount of information offered in the reports. Or perhaps I assumed users would want to read all of the information, but 
instead the user was not that interested in the details of the information. In a focus group interview, I would try to 
find more participants suited to fit the target user of 23andMe, and ask them more specific questions such as what types 
of info in the reports they are most interested in, and what functions they use the most, etc.
