  Based on the findings of the heuristic evaluation, the usability test was designed to find out whether the user 
would find the information presented on the 23andMe app too complicated to understand and navigate through. Three 
scenarios were designed around the main functions built into the app: presenting ancestry reports, presenting health 
reports, and answering research questions. 
  The tasks were designed in steps, from easier to harder. The test was structured such that each task in a certain 
scenario could be found under the same heading/menu page in the app. During the process of completing the steps, the
user could go at his or her own pace to explore the functions available in the app.
